# ODALAP
Open Data Analysis Linking Archiving Platform

## Introduction
ODALAP stands for Open Data Analysis Linking Archiving Platform. ODALAP is an open platform to receive, analyze, link and archive data to support organisations and people to extract meaning out of massive amounts of information which is being created and provided. 

Organizations are creating and receiving data in all kind of forms on a daily basis. This creates the problem that the pool of available data becomes rapidly so vast that it is impossible for a human to find all relevant data and to get true meaning out of individual large documents. ODALAP extracts meaning out of each document by leveraging artificial intelligence technology.
